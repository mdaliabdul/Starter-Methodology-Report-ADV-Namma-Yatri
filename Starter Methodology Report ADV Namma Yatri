2.2.	 Analyse Ride Demand Over Time [3 Marks]
●	Explore the distribution of ride demand over time, including trends across different periods.
●	Identify the peak demand periods. Choose an appropriate parameter for demand based on your own understanding.
Solution:
________________________________________

Demand – number of trips/ Ride requests
Distribution of Demand
•	Demand varies significantly by time of day:
o	Morning (7–10 hrs): High demand due to office/school commute.
o	Afternoon (12–15 hrs): Moderate demand with a dip (non-commute trips).
o	Evening (17–20 hrs): Highest demand, reflecting peak return commute.
o	Late Night (22–2 hrs): Lowest demand, fewer trips booked.
Peak Demand Periods
•	Evenings (17–20 hrs) are the peak demand period.
•	Mornings (7–10 hrs) are the secondary peak.

Count(tripid)

Demand by duration:
The commonest trip duration – 1
Both Short and long rides dominate demand 

Demand by distance:
50% of demand occurs distance less than 15

Demand by driver ID:
Driver ID 11 has lowest demand (2%)
Driver ID 12 has highest demand (5%)

Location_from and to
Location from 18 and location to 29 has highest demand.

Analysis: 
Ride demand is highest during the evening peak (17–20 hrs), followed by the morning peak (7–10 hrs), with a noticeable dip in the afternoon and the lowest demand during late-night hours. This reflects commuting behaviour as the primary driver of demand.

2.10.	Create a Parameter and Use Filters [5 Marks]
●	Create a parameter and use it as a filter on an appropriate subset of the data to interactively analyse and visualise different subsets of the data.
●	Explain your choice of filter and insights drawn from this step.
Solution:
________________________________________

A parameter on Trip Duration was created and used as a filter to analyse subsets of data. This revealed that trip completion varies strongly by time: low (50%) in early morning and high (85.7%) in evening peak hours. The insight highlights when customer intent is strongest and when support measures may be needed.
Filtering by time shows travel behaviour differences:
•	Peak hours (commuting) → higher intent, more completions.
•	Off-peak/late night → lower completions, possible safety or availability concerns.
This parameterised filter helps in targeting interventions (e.g., driver incentives in late night slots).
